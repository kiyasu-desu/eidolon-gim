"""Readings (GLOSSARY.md「读音」): how names are said in the characters' voices, e.g. 月村手毬
as つきむら てまり, 初星学園 as はつぼしがくえん.

They are in the readings file beside the character configuration (`readings.toml`),
committed with it and kept by the deployer: each entry is a name as it is written, its
reading in kana for people to read and change, and the phonemes Fish Audio is told
(OpenJTalk's romaji with pitch digits, as `ha0shi1ga0`). `eidolon reading draft`
(`reading_draft`) drafts the file and fills in phonemes left empty. The server reads it
as it starts; the admin console cannot change it.

Every request to Fish Audio, the greetings' (`greetings`) and the calls' (`call.FishTTS`),
on the deployer's key or a user's own, carries every entry with phonemes as its
pronunciation dictionary (`pronunciation_dictionary`). Fish Audio matches the keys in
what it is told to say as written, so what it says, and what people see, keep the names
as they are written. It skips a dictionary it cannot use without saying so: whether a
name is said right is for people to hear.
