"""Calls in stats (GLOSSARY.md「统计」, ADR-0021): each call that connected is kept in the
conversation it is in, when it connected and how long it lasted once it had, as its activity
record says, whoever hung up and whatever ended it, the conversation ended elsewhere
meanwhile or not; one that never connected is not. The range takes in those that connected
in it, where the user is: how many, how long all told, and each character's. Kept apart
from the conversation's record, they go with it, and with the user. Driven through the
backend's external API, with a browser calling in over a real WebRTC connection and fake
outside services; when a call connected is put in the database as if it had been then."""
