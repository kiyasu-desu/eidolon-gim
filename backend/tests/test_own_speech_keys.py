"""Bringing your own speech keys, and what bringing your own keys exempts from the limits.

Fish Audio (speech synthesis) and Soniox or Alibaba Cloud Model Studio (speech recognition,
whichever the user chose) keys are tried once, without being kept, before the browser keeps
them. Before a call, the browser says which services it will bring its own keys for
(`own`), and is told whether the call would count; the call itself brings the keys
(`own_keys` in the offer's request data), which decide whose services it runs on and
whether it counts, whatever was said before. One that fails ends the call saying which,
without falling back to the deployer's. Calls count towards the hourly limit unless the
LLM, synthesis and recognition are all the user's own (text turns on their own LLM: see
test_admission). How long a call may last and how many turns it may take is the same for
everyone."""
