"""She hangs up (GLOSSARY.md「通话」「冷却」「不该说的话」): in a call, the turn that takes her
affinity to 0, the second time in that call the user is out of line, or the turn that has
what the call's latest turns took off her affinity add up to too much, has her told to hang
up once she has said it; once it is recorded and what is on its way to her voice is voiced,
the browser is told `ended`, why (`cooldown`, with when it ends, or `she_hung_up`) and that
the call counted, along with the「挂断了电话」event, written into the conversation there and
then. Halfway there, she warns the user first, once till it eases. The call is a success,
ended by her (「角色挂断」). What is out of line, and what hurt her, is counted in that call
alone; a turn that fails is not counted, nor does she hang up after it. Her
hanging up comes before the call's limits, reached by the same turn. A follow-on has the
whole of what the user said judged afresh; her last line cut short, she hangs up all the
same.

Driven through the backend's external API, with a browser calling in over a real WebRTC
connection and the judge model faked turn by turn; what needs its timing held exactly, at
the Pipecat stage that takes the call's turns (see `test_call_turns.py`)."""
